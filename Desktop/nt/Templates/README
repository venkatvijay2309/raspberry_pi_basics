This directory contains the templates used in the Linux Driver workshops
conducted at SysPlay eLearning Academy for You.

Many of them are w.r.t. the custom hardware LDDK. For version compatibility,
look into the file VERSIONS. Details about the LDDK could be found under the
LDDK folder.

You may compile these templates by typing make in the toplevel folder or
individual folders after setting the KERNEL_SOURCE variable to your kernel's
source directory in the top-level Makefile & module.mk

Check out the SEQUENCE file for knowing the order in which you need to play
with the content.
